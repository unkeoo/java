type conversion for more data types

computer cannot exactly represent decimal values. they use approximation for it 

byte b= 10; (10 being a int constant)
(this works ^)

float a = 1.7
(this doesnt work ^)

hardware cannot produce infinite values so it uses approximation

public class Example2 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        System.out.printlm(0.1+0.2);
    }
}

output is 0.30000000000000004

common problem for all languages

-if you want to make it a float you need to add capital f or small f at the end , 1.7f; or 1.7F;  (suffix declaration) or float a = (float) 1.7; (type casting or Explicit conversion)
