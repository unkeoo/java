import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name;
        System.out.println("What is ur name");
        name = kb.nextLine();
        System.out.println("GOOD EVENING "+name);
    }
}



TWO METHODS TO READ STRINGS ^ 
next= single word will be read
nextLine= Complete line will be read


method if you only want one character read 
=====================================

2 ways - 


1.charAt 

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in);
        String str;
        System.out.println("enter character");
        str = kb.next();
        char ch;
        ch=str.charAt(0);
        System.out.println("Character is "+ch);
    }
}

2. read System.in.read



LOOPS (Iterative Statement)
==============================

Loop is a programming concept which says that it can repeat its body multiple times until a particular condition remains true.

Types of loops 
================

Entry controlled loop
1.while
2. for


Exit controlled loop
1. do while 



Syntax of While loop in java
=========================


    while (test_cond)
    {
        .......


        .......
    }

    (will run until condition is fullfilled, if condtion doesnt match it wont start)
    (if you dont put braces it will read only 1 line) 
    .
