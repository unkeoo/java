Javas Math class 

1. The java language provides us a special class called as math which is present in the package java.lang 

2. As the name suggests the class math provides us some mathematical constants as well as some functions for mathematical calculations.

3. Every member of math class in java is static so to access/use them we just have to prefix them iwth the name of math class.
