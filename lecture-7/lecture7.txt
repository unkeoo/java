Type conversion
==============
if i say 
int a=10;
a=b;
then b= will also be 10

Type conversion is the process wihcih gets applied when we use ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR between variables of 2 different data types 

types of conversion
1. Implicit conversion(automatically done by java compiler)

2.Explicit conversion(coversion done by programmer, also called by type casting)


rules for implicit conversion 
1.values must be compatible
example 1. 
int x;
x='A';---------------(unicode is 65)
//this conversion works because char and int are compatible

example 2.
int x;

x=true;
// this conversion doesnt work because boolean cannot be converted to int(incompatible types)
(BOOLEAN IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITYH ANY OTHER DATA TYPES)
2. the value on RHS of assignment operator must be of smaller type than the variable on LHS




int 4b- -2147483648 to 2147483647
float 4b - 3.4 * 10^38 to 3.4 * 10 ^38
long 8b - -9223372036254775808 to 9223372036254775807 
float 4b - -3.4*10^38 to 3.4 * 10^38 


rules for Explicit conversion var_name=(data_type)value;

int x;
x=(int)7.4;


example for Explicit coversion
x=(byte)a;

if you use a number outside the range there will be data loss, for example
int x = 128;
byte a;
a=x;
value will print as -128
