Developing java programs (two main)
1 Vs code
2 IntelliJ IDEA/eclipse/netbeans


installing vs code
(folder process)
how to open a folder from drives in vs code
installing two extensions
(prettier,language support for java)
prettier-manages spaces, indents managed,makes it look better by auto formatting
language support- syntax support


difference between vs code and using an ide like netbeans/eclipse/IntelliJ idea etc
Vs CODE
-Using vs code-typing the code in vs code and running it through command prompt.
-good for beginners for learning each step thoroughly

Using an IDE
-should be used after we have understood the basic working of java
- IDE hides all the basic steps which are important to understand(not reccomended for beginners)

Developing java programs in vs code
1. writing source code
2. compling the code
(conversion from source code to bytecode by the java compiler)
3. execute the code
(interpration of the bytecode by the jvm)

 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING JAVA 25
 in 25  we can write the program in 2 ways;
 - Using the regular/traditional syntax.
 - Using new syntax called compact source files , introduced by java 25.
 -Intitally we will follow the traditional way and afterwords 


 class Test
 {
    public static void main(String [ ]args)
 {
       System.out.println("Hello user");
 }
 }

 Class- a block of code
 - you can name the class anything (here its Test)
not compulsary but you should name the file and class the same for the best practice
 {- block opening bracket
 }-block cosing bracket
 public- access modifier 
 static- non access modifier
 void- return type
 main-method
 method-collection of statements

 JVM executes the code (starts from main) main-entry point
code can compile without main but wont run

Java inherited by c and c++

SOUT- command line argument
if anything is capitalised its a class made by java(pre defined class)
[]- array symbol
args and square brackets are inter changable 
 args full form- argument String
 main closing and opening brace-
inside main^- System.out.println("Hello User);
System- pre defined class
out-object reference
println-method

(DONT TYPE ANYTHING WRITTEN IN GREY)

;- statement terminator
