steps
1. Write the source code
2. compile ---> bytecode(understood by java virutal machine)
3. run

To compile
1. open the terminal in VS code
2. command to compile is called javac then write ur file name

What java does
1.Checks your syntax (capitalisation etc semicolon)
2. if there is errors (even one) java will not turn it into bytecode
3.when java makes bytecode it names it makes a seperate extension called .class

3 THINGS ABOUT bytecode
1.extension is called .class
2.name -- same name as class name (the one you have created)
3. the number of classes the user has defined for eg (5), there will also be 5 bytecode

shortcut to open terminal - Ctrl+~

Syntax to run inside the terminal
java Main class(sca used Test )

comparing C language with java
C- uses a header file #include <stdio.h>
java-no header file , keeps classes in packages (jdk folders)
java 25 (has more than 225 packages, around 4.5k classes)

java adds java.lang class autmatically
(import java.lang.*;) at the top of ur code

Important interview question
in C 
====

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello");
    return 0;
}
// here it appears to be 6 lines of code but its actually around 450 because of all the imported functions from #include <stdio.h>


In java
====

class Test
{
    public static void main(String [] args)

{
System.out.println("Hello User");
}
}

(java only calls however many it needs not like c)



-students make a common mistake writing String in lowercase

println- makes a line after ENDING of println command
if you want it all in the same line write print and not println

\n- is called a escape sequence (will be explained in next lecture)(just like its used in c lang)

print always requires an argument, but println does not
